# Adventuring Supply Company

As a young goblin you always dreamed of opening up your own shop and selling beautiful sparklies to all sorts of adventurers.

So, when the Dragon Mafioso offered you a deal to run a shop, you signed instantly. However, you should have read the fine print, because now you are forever indebted to the dragon and are in a little game to see how long you can run this shop before he burns it, and you, to the ground.

Adventuring Supply Company is a single-player business simulation game where you buy and sell items while dealing with events that happen while running a shop in a fantasy world. However, you also owe a dragon a lot of money, and must pay the installment at the end of the day, or else.

The game was created by Dragon Mafia Studio, a team made up of Ball State students Austin Tinkel​​, Daniel Gonzalez, Josh Johannsen, Katelynn Gossage, Matt Schrag, and Zachary Hughes as part of a project for the CS 490: Software Development Studio in the Spring 2020 semester.
